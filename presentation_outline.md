*  Fantasy football is a game that allows you to be the owner, GM and coach of your very own NFL football team.
* You compete against other owners in your league to score points based on the performance of your players in real NFL football games.
* We collected football score data from ESPN and the NFL and use this data to build dashboards summarizing the data about each player. 
* With the current data you can make predictions using machine learning models for each player for the upcomming season. All of this work was deployed to a web app that you have in front of you.

Stan: Will talk about the heroku deployment 

Stan:

* App was deployed on Heroku. We used flask to specify the routes for different pages in the app as well as deploy machine learning code. 

* Tableau dashboards were embedded into the pages and the data was stored in SQL database deployed on Heroku as well. 

* Trained ML models were saved as binary files and loaded them into flask code. 

Mason - Player Evaluation page 

* Scrapped Data from ESPN
* Objective is to evaluate indivual players 
* How to use the dashboard

John: 

* Dashboard to make a rough draft of a player
* Identify under-valued players
* How to use the dashboard 

Anderson:

* Understand the data, KNN and classification
* Making the linear regression model
* Utilize pickle for model deployment(.sav, .gz) 
* Demostrate good and bad player to choose
